# 🚛 Carbon Footprint Optimization in Supply Chain Logistics 🌱

This project uses deep learning to optimize delivery routes for **minimal carbon emissions**, helping logistics companies make environmentally conscious decisions. It considers key factors like **route distance, fuel usage, weather conditions, traffic levels, and cargo weight**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional logistics systems focus on cost and time, often overlooking environmental impact. This project proposes a data-driven approach to **reduce carbon emissions** by predicting and selecting optimal delivery routes.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas / NumPy / Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

---

## 🔁 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Simulated or real-world data from fleet systems, weather APIs, map services.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, encoding, handling missing values.
3. **Model Training**: Supervised deep learning using Keras.
4. **Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, and % error on carbon prediction.
5. **Route Suggestion**: Predicts emissions and suggests the most eco-friendly route.
